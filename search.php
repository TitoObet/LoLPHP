                    <p> Lavender is native to the mountainous zones of the Mediterranean where it grows in sunny, stony habitats. Lavender is a heavily branched short shrub that grows to a height of roughly 60 centimeters (about 24 inches). Its broad rootstock bears woody branches with upright, rod like, leafy, green shoots. A silvery down covers the gray green narrow leaves, which are oblong and tapered, attached directly at the base, and curled spirally. The oil in lavender's small, blue violet flowers gives the herb its fragrant scent. The flowers are arranged in spirals of 6 to 10 blossoms, forming interrupted spikes above the foliage. </font></p>

A tall, straight, deciduous tree, up to150 ft. tall (sometimes taller), tulip tree has a medium to narrow crown and distinctive, star-shaped foliage. The leaves are waxy and smooth, and dependably turn bright gold in fall. Showy, yellow-orange, tulip-like flowers are often missed because they are up 50 ft. or higher in the tops of trees. Cone-shaped seedheads remain after leaves have fallen.

The leaves are typically used fresh as a culinary herb, and the flowers are dried and used to flavour candy, desserts, beverages, salads, and other foods.

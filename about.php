        <h1> WHAT IS HERBAL? </h1>
		<p> Herbal medicine has its origins in ancient cultures. It involves the medicinal use of plants to treat disease and 
		enhance general health and wellbeing. Some herbs have potent (powerful) ingredients and should be taken with the same 
		level of caution as pharmaceutical medications. In fact, many pharmaceutical medications are based on man-made versions of 
		naturally occurring compounds found in plants. For instance, the heart medicine digitalis was derived from the foxglove plant. 
		<br><br>
		Herbal medicines contain active ingredients. The active ingredients of many herbal preparations are as yet unknown. Some 
		pharmaceutical medications are based on a single active ingredient derived from a plant source. Practitioners of herbal 
		medicine believe that an active ingredient can lose its impact or become less safe if used in isolation from the rest 
		of the plant.

		<h1> PURPOSE OF WEBSITE </h1>
		<p> The purpose of this website is for users to know how good herbal medicines are for preventing illnesses and 
		diseases. Herbal medicines nowadays are often overlooked, as they are sometimes preferred to as placebo and 
		fake medicines. Luckily enough, the herbal medicine scene in the Philippines is somewhat better compared to 
		other countries, and it is a good starting point when introducing research based, herbal alternatives.
		Leaves of Life will acknowledge the different types of herbal medicines and supplements that can easily be 
		considered as counterparts of prescription medicines. Users can have access to all possible alternatives, based 
		on their diagnosis and needs. Most of the herbal medicines that this website presents are easy to be planted and 
		grown in our own households. One of the main purposes of Leaves of Life is to guide people on which plants they 
		should grow and how they could grow them. Lastly, Leaves of Life also wants people who are financially challenged 
		to be able to look for cheaper alternatives and avoid expensive medicines in the pharmacy. This allows them to make 
		the most out of their money and prevent overspending on unnecessarily priced medicines.
